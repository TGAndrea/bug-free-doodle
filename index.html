        <h2>Planets of our Solar system</h2>
        <p>Our solar system exists out of 8, formerly 9, planets. Up until 2006 Pluto was part of the main planets, but got voted off
        due to not meeting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto">third condition</a> of what makes a planet a planet.

            <div class="dropdown"><span>About Mercury</span>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><p>Mercury is the first planet in our solar system. Meaning it also is the closest one to
                    the sun! Like Earth it is a terrestial planet, yet is the smallest one in our solar system.</p></div>

            <div class="dropdown"><span>About Venus</span>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><p>Being the second planet in our solar system, Venus is about the same size as Earth, but 
                    due to being so close to the sun Venus is incredibly hot. Unlike Earth, Venus has a very weak magnetic field.

            <div class="dropdown"><span>About Earth</span>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><p>Earth, our home planet, is the third planet in our solar system. It is located in what
                    scientists call: the Goldilocks zone. This means Earth is located in the perfect spot for life to flourish; not too hot 
                and not too cold.</p></div>

            <div class="dropdown"><span>About Mars</span>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><p>The fourth planet in our solar system is Mars. It is about the same size as Earth,
                    but is a lot colder and hostile. Mars lacks Earth's gravitional field and is often subjected to enormous dust storms and 
                    temperatures reaching between -140 °C and 20 °C.

            <div class="dropdown"><span>About Jupiter</span>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><p>The fifth and largest planet of our solar system is the gas giant Jupiter. This means Jupiter has 
                    no surface. Jupiter is well known for its great red spot which is a giant storm the size of the Earth.

            <div class="dropdown"><span>About Saturn</span>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><p>Saturn, the sixth planet, is known for its magnificent rings. Like Jupiter, Saturn is also a 
                    gas giant.

            <div class="dropdown"><span>About Uranus</span>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><p>The seventh planet, Uranus, is often the butt of many jokes. The axis of Uranus is tilted
                    in a 98° angle, also known as obliquity. It is speculated this is due to the enormous gravitational pull Uranus is under from 
                    its larger neighbours.

            <div class="dropdown"><span>About Neptune</span>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><p>The eight, and technically final planet of our solar system, is Neptune. Well known for
                    its gorgues blue colour, Neptune is very similar to Uranus. Its blue colour is due to the high concentration of methane 
                    in its atmoshpere.

            <div class="dropdown"><span>About Pluto</span>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><p>As explained above, the ninth planet Pluto no longer meets the condition to be called a planet.
                    But it will always remain one in our hearts!
